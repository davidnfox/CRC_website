#### We are long time makers with a shared love of simple, functional, hand crafted items. We decided to combine our crafts into a collaborative effort and to share our work with our local community and further afield.

#### David

I've always been fascinated with wood and have been carving and making things since I was a kid. There's something compelling about making and using materials from nature for our everyday needs. I work with local woods, mostly found on our own land, and harvest material that has already fallen, been damaged, and occasional non-native invasive species. I finish my items with food safe materials like walnut oil and beeswax.

Each piece I craft is an opportunity for contemplation; of the moment that inspired the design, of the craft traditions and teachers I am indebted to, and of the tactile now-ness of creation. My hope is that my work brings grace and joy to your life, too.
